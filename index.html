    <h1>What is Two Factor Authentication (2FA)?</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2><u><em>Two-factor Authentication (2FA):</em></u></h2>

    <p><br>
        <b>Two-factor authentication (2FA) is an identity and access management security method that requires two forms of identification to access resources and data. 2FA gives businesses the ability to monitor and help safeguard their most vulnerable information and networks.<br>
           <br>Businesses use 2FA to help protect their employees’ personal and business assets. This is important because it prevents cybercriminals from stealing, destroying, or accessing your internal data records for their own use.
 <br>

           The advantages of 2FA are endless. For example, with 2FA, there’s no need for users to carry or download a token generator, or an app associated with one. Most websites use your mobile device to text, call, or use a personalized 2FA for their business to verify your identity.
            
          <br> 
           Some other advantages of 2FA include:
           
            <br><br>
           
           • There’s no need to use a hardware token generator. These types of 2FA methods are often lost or misplaced. However, with advanced technology, 2FA methods are more convenient than ever.<br>
           • Passcode generators are more efficient than traditional passwords. Generators are the safer option because no two passcodes are the same.<br>
           • Max passcode entry prevents cybercriminals from hacking and accessing sensitive data.<br>
           • The process is manageable and user-friendly.<br>

           <br>
           
           Two way authentication is a better way to do your password more stronger than before. It can be a better option for both of your Gmail and facebook authentication.
